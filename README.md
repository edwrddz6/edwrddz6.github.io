# Welcome to Edward's Personal Page!

## Hello, I'm Edward, a web developer passionate about learning and collaboration. I enjoy playing guitar, exercising, traveling, and hanging out with my Alaskan Malamute in my free time!

## As of now, I'm currently honing my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm eager to collaborate on projects to help me apply and enhance my skills. Let's connect and build something great together!
